# When building on Raspberry Pi, you need to get the hardware
# accelerated graphics driver enabled with SDL2.
# We borrow the SDL2 build from RetroPie which takes care of this for us.

git clone https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup
cd RetroPie-Setup
sudo ./retropie_packages.sh sdl2


# Then build GSplus like any other *nix system
sudo apt-get install -y libpcap0.8-dev libsdl2-image-dev re2c cmake
git clone https://github.com/digarok/gsplus.git
mkdir build ; cd build
cmake ..
