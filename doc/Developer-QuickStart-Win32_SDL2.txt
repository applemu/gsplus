# Win32 - SDL2 version
#
# This should build a `gsplus.exe` executable and copy it to the project root dir.
# You can run it, though as always you need to supply an Apple IIgs ROM file.
# Have fun, and please note any errors on the issues page of the project.


# Prerequisites: You must install Cygwin on your system.
#   I install Cygwin with all "Devel" and "Perl" packages.
#   I also search for and add any FreeType libs.
#   If you want to deploy to s3 (gitlabci) then also add pip for python.
#   If you are deploying the packages then you also need zip.
#   You will not use the Cygwin SDL2/image libraries as they are deprecated.
#   Instead you must download the mingw64-w64 libraries and link against those.

# Build.
git clone git@github.com:digarok/gsplus.git
md build ; cd build
cmake ..
make


# if you want to make a machine that can also deploy to s3 (gitlabci):
pip2.7 install awscli

# aws creds are to be passed via CI environment variables
# also, you have to fix the behavior for windows to run this.
# open an Administrator CMD prompt and run:
assoc .py=pyautofile
ftype pyautofile="c:\cygwin\bin\python" "%1" %*
